    "introduction": "Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning…… no doubt you’ve heard these terms, but are they just buzz words used by those to sound more important or is there something more real to it and can help our children???",
    "conclusion": "Growing up, our minds were corrupted by all those sci-fi movies that painted a near-distant future of flying cars, personal robot assistants (Tony Stark’s Jarvis), and being able to take a vacation to Mars!  In recent years, many of these ideas have become more tangible as businesses and individuals find more practical use cases for them.  From driverless cars, smart home appliances, finding cures to diseases, predicting stock prices, finding the next gold mine, to the trusty voice assistant on your smartphone that finds the nearest café when you need a caffeine hit… this technology is becoming more a part of our lives.",

Imagine your child building their own robot which follows their commands, a plane launcher that takes the humble paper plane to heights no other paper plane as gone before, or a motorized boat that can change to a robot that can draw!",
      "And for those whose thirst for such knowledge does even deeper, STEM connects industry leading teachers with students through a structured online learning program. Each lesson is online with no lesson is the same! Courses are designed for to suit kids of all ages as well as parents so you can learn together! So why not make it a family learning experience!"

    "conclusion": "Over the coming weeks we’ll also be scheduling some ICT for Parents classes so feel free to register your interest here so we can contact you when they’re available. I hope the above helps, and just remember, like all homework, it’s a journey! You’re not expected to be an expert; you just need to be the guide.",
    "points": [
      "1. Talk to your child – ask them to explain to you what they are doing in ICT. You’ll probably hear words like Raspberry Pi, Kalebr, 21st Century skills and de-bugging.  And when you do ask them to explain those concepts to you. Simply by doing this, you’re helping your child revise their learnings and testing if they can clearly explain each concept.",
      "2. Ask them to demonstrate a project to you – your child has probably already being exposed to robotics, where they had to physically or virtually design a robot (or any other moving vehicle) and then use code to teach it commands. You’ll be amazed at what they’ll demonstrate. And as they do continue to ask them “So how did you do that part?” This is all helping them think through the “how” and the sequence of actions that need to happen for it to function.",
      "3. Presentation & Reflection – now here’s where your English and communication skills help. A key part of ICT is for kids to demonstrate how they’ve achieved their finished product.  Kids are asked to explain the Objective, the How (including coding commands, functions, hardware, circuits, boards) as well as reflect on what they learnt and what could be done better next time.  Most of the time this is done in PowerPoint, so get your child to take you through it and cross-reference this against the Task List assigned by the teacher.  To me, this is one area where kids still need their parent’s help more than ever.",
      "4. Speak to your child’s teacher – don’t wait for the school report! Schedule some time in with teach at the beginning of the new academic year for them to take you through the ICT curriculum for your child’s upcoming year.  Keep a copy so you can use this as a weekly checkpoint with your child.  Also ask your child’s teacher on any good reference material you can review to help you understand the information that’ll be taught. This could be website links, YouTube channel or even the school’s own material.",
      "5. Complete a project together – Purchase one online coding subscription and make it family project where you both get to learn and have fun."
